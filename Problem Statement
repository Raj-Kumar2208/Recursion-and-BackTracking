Here, trying to solve the question, GCD_Strings:
Question Statement as follow:
Define the GCD-String of two integers a,b with a >= b to be a binary string of length a that satisfies the following:
i) g(a,b)= 100...000 (1 followed by a-1 zeros) if a is divisible by b
ii) g(a,b) = First a characters of S(g(b,a%b))

Definition of S(P) as an infinite string with S[i] = P[i%N] for all i>=0.
Informally, S(P) is the concatenation of P with itself an infinite number.

Inputs :                Outputs
a=3,b=1                 100
a=3,b=2                 101
a=5,b=2                 10101
a=10,b=4                1000100010
