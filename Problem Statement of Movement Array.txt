Consider an array A of size N. You start from the index 0 and your goal is to reach index N-1.
in exactly M moves.

At any index, you can move forward or backward by a number of steps that is equal to a prime divisor of the value which exists at that index. You cannot go beyond the array while going forward or backward.

Write a program to determine whether it is possible to reach index N-1 in M moves.
