Find the length of connected cells of 1s (regions) in an matrix of 0s and 1s:
Given a matrix, each of which may be 1 or 0. The filled cells that are connected
form a region. Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other
horizontally, vertically, diagonally. There may be several regions in the matrix.
How do you find the largest region in the matrix?
Sample Input: matrix: [[1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[0,1,0,1,1]]
Sample Output: 5
